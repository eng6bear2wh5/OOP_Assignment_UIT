                          OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING (OOP) - UNIVERSITY OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (UIT)

This is a list of directories and files with content about assignments with programming language C++. These contents are resolved based on the practical topic of OOP subject at University of Information and Technology (UIT).
These contents are only the reference for the topic. You can have many other ways to address these problems with higher performance and advanced method.
NOTE:
I advise you to use VISUAL STUDIO IDE ( for easily distinguish, in basic term, this IDE called "purple version") which is an effective tool with various functions that helps you to learn OOP.
When you write a code project with OOP method, you should separate the header of the program from the main function which helps the program more clear and easily to be managed.
